* cpputils-cmake.el (v0.5.1)
*Perfect* syntax check (Flymake) and code-completion if you use [[http://www.cmake.org][CMake]].

cpputils-cmake does all the dirty setup *automatically* for following plugins and commands,
- [[http://flymake.sourceforge.net/][Flymake]]
- [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]]
- [[http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/][auto-complete]]
- [[https://github.com/brianjcj/auto-complete-clang][auto-complete-clang]]
- [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]]
- [[https://github.com/randomphrase/company-c-headers][company-c-headers]]
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Semantic.html][semantic]]
- [[https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode][iron-mode]]
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CompileCommand]["M-x compile"]]
- "M-x ff-find-other-file" (if you press `C-x C-o` in C/C++ file, ff-find-other-file will open *correct* header file under cursor)

Please note cpputils-cmake is *independent* on those plugins. Only CMake is required.

Tested at Emacs 23.4, 24.3, 24.4
* Install
** Easy way
cpputils-cmake is available at [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa]].

The best way is using Emacs package manager.

** Manual way
Download and place cpputils-cmake.el somewhere (say ~/.emacs/lisp), add below code into your .emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'cpputils-cmake)
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Insert below code into your .emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
          (lambda ()
            (if (derived-mode-p 'c-mode 'c++-mode)
                (cppcm-reload-all)
              )))
;; OPTIONAL, somebody reported that they can use this package with Fortran
(add-hook 'c90-mode-hook (lambda () (cppcm-reload-all)))
;; OPTIONAL, avoid typing full path when starting gdb
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-g")
 '(lambda ()(interactive) (gud-gdb (concat "gdb --fullname " (cppcm-get-exe-path-current-buffer)))))
;; OPTIONAL, some users need specify extra flags forwarded to compiler
(setq cppcm-extra-preprocss-flags-from-user '("-I/usr/src/linux/include" "-DNDEBUG"))
#+END_SRC

Quick start:
- Step 1, The build directory should have the *same name as value of cppcm-build-dirname*. It is "build" by default. Make sure the build is located somewhere in the directory hierarchy from C++ file
- Step 2, Go to build directory to *run cmake and make at least once!*

* Demo (OPTIONAL)
Let's start by creating a "hello world" C++ project:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir -p hello/src;printf "#include <stdio.h>\nint main(void) {\nprintf(\"hello world\");\nreturn 0;\n}" > hello/src/main.cpp;printf "cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)\nadd_executable(main main.cpp)" > hello/src/CMakeLists.txt
#+END_SRC

** flycheck
[[https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/184553/5368798/ca25c044-805e-11e4-9859-805601784519.png]]

You can also `M-x cppcm-compile` to compile the current excutable only.

** gdb
Press hotkey `C-c C-g` (I suppose you've copied my setup).

gud-gdb starts and the binary "~/your-projects-blah-blah/hello/build/main" is loaded automatically.

** auto-complete
You also need install auto-complete-clang.

** Open header file
Press the hotkey `C-x C-o` or `M-x ff-find-other-file`. The corresponding header is opened.

* FAQ
** Avoid scanning system header files
Scanning is light weight enough so below code is *optional*:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
          (lambda ()
            (if (derived-mode-p 'c-mode 'c++-mode)
                (if  (not (or (string-match "^/usr/local/include/.*" buffer-file-name)
                              (string-match "^/usr/src/linux/include/.*" buffer-file-name)))
                    (cppcm-reload-all))
              )))
#+END_SRC
** Get executable's full path
The command "cppcm-get-exe-path-current-buffer" will copy current executable into kill ring AND OS clipboard.

You need install `xsel` under Linux to support OS clipboard.

This could be useful if you need access the executable's directory.

You can yank (paste) the full path to eshell or minibuffer and press "M-backspace" to get the directory name.

** Reload cpputils-cmake
You can always `M-x cppcm-reload-all` any time *in C/C++ files*.

There is also `cppcm-reload-all-hook` which will be called after `cppcm-reload-all`. This give you a chance to tweak or override the setup *if and only if* you are Emacs Lisp expert. Most users *don't* need tweak these global variables.

Here is the list of global variables third party plugins use:
| variable name                           | plugin              |
|-----------------------------------------+---------------------|
| ac-clang-flags                          | auto-complete-clang |
| company-clang-arguments                 | company-mode        |
| cc-search-directories                   | ff-find-other-file  |
| flycheck-clang-include-path             | flycheck            |
| semantic-dependency-system-include-path | semantic            |
| company-c-headers-path-system           | company-c-headers   |

** Compile only current target
"M-x cppcm-compile".

Please press "C-h v cppcm-compile-list" for other compile options.

** Make clean && make
"M-x cppcm-recompile"

** Customize target path
For example, if the CMakeLists.txt contains something like this:
#+begin_src cmake
set(CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/lib)
set(CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/lib)
set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin)
#+end_src

cpputils-cmake cannot find the target (executable or library).

It will then call the variable cppcm-get-executable-full-path-callback which could be a function object.

Here is a sample:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq cppcm-get-executable-full-path-callback
      (lambda (path type tgt-name)
        ;; path is the supposed-to-be target's full path
        ;; type is either add_executabe or add_library
        ;; tgt-name is the target to built. The target's file extension is stripped
        (message "cppcm-get-executable-full-path-callback called => %s %s %s" path type tgt-name)
        (let ((dir (file-name-directory path))
              (file (file-name-nondirectory path)))
          (cond
           ((string= type "add_executable")
            (setq path (concat dir "bin/" file)))
           ;; for add_library
           (t (setq path (concat dir "lib/" file)))
           ))
        ;; return the new path
        (message "cppcm-get-executable-full-path-callback called => path=%s" path)
        path))
#+end_src

You can insert above code into ~/.emacs!

** Macro and included cmake file
cpputils-cmake assumes that CMakeLists.txt contains a rule to create executable.

*The rule is either "add_executable" or "add_library"*.

Included file and macro in CMakeLists.txt will be *ignored*.

A sample CMakeLists.txt we can handle:
#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
project(proj1)
set(VAR2 "a2")
set(VAR1 a1-${VAR2})
set(TGT hello-${PROJECT_NAME}-${VAR1}")
add_executable(${TGT} ${SOURCES})
#+END_SRC

The executable's name will be "hello-proj1-a1-a2".

** Stop creating Makefiles for flymake
Insert below code into ~/.emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq cppcm-write-flymake-makefile nil)
#+END_SRC

* Bug Report
Check [[https://github.com/redguardtoo/cpputils-cmake]].

Here is the steps to send bug report:
- open cpp file in your real project
- `M-x eval-expression`
- paste (setq cppcm-debug t) into mini-buffer and press ENTER
- `M-x cppcm-reload-all` and send me the output in Message buffer
- `C-h v cppcm-hash` and send me the output
- `M-x cppcm-version` and send the output

Besides, I still need general environment information like Emacs version and OS version.
